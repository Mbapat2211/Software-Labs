//Description: A program that can store and add complex numbers

*class complex is defined
-> private members: real_no, img_no
-> public members: default contructors [unparameterized, one parameter, two parameters]
		   getdata() [function to user input data into class variable]
		   show() [function to display the complex number]
		   sum() [function to add two complex numbers]

*main contains three class complex variables invoked using the 3 constructors
*the variable invoked using the unparameterized constructor is used to call the getdata() function to store user inputed values
*all the three variables are used to display the complex number using the show() function
*the two variables invoked using the two parameterized constructors are added using the sum() function and the sum complex number is displayed as well.
